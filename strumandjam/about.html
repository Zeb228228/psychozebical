  <h1>About Guitar Jam Club</h1>

  <section class="section">
    <p>Welcome to the Guitar Jam Club — a space for teenage musicians to connect, jam, learn, and grow together. Whether you're playing acoustic ballads, metal solos, or just starting out, we believe music is better shared.</p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>We’re a community of 30+ guitar players between the ages of 13–19 from different schools and neighborhoods. The club was started in 2021 by a few friends who just wanted to jam in the park — and it’s been growing ever since!</p>
